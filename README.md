# MazeGenerator

A program that generates a maze in the form of an image using an input of maze size and image size.

Generation implemented by storing all walls and spaces of the maze in a 2d array that functions as a graph and then randomly picking a wall to remove. Using a disjoint set with each open (non-wall) space of the maze starting as its own partition, the program checks to make sure the two neighboring spaces of the wall being removed are in different partitions. If the neighbors are in different partitions, the partitions are unioned together and the wall is removed. Otherwise, the wall is left in place. The program does this for every wall, resulting in a maze with no loops. This procudure of generating a maze is known as randomized Kruskal's algorithm.

Solution to the maze implemented using a non-recursive depth first search algorithm.

Here is an example generated by the program:
